## Project Description

EconOMatic combines information about the game's economy into one easy-to-use API. It's great for players interested in
the market or for professional gold traders. The API can also be plugged into your own projects to build custom tools
and applications.
This API makes it easy for players to understand the game's economy, make smart trading decisions, and plan their gold
farming strategies. It gives all of this information in a simple and clear way, making it accessible for everyone.

## Features

EconOMatic API has a bunch of useful features. Let's take a look at some of them:

1. ### Server Information Retrieval
   You can get a list of available servers for WoW Classic WOTLK, including their names, regions, and other important
   details.

2. ### Item Information Retrieval
   You can also get information about the items in the game, like their IDs, names, descriptions, and rarity.

3. ### Population Retrieval for Servers
   Get population stats for each server, including the player count and faction distribution. This can help you choose
   the
   right server and get a sense of the game's demographics. Population information is provided
   by [WarcraftTavern](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/population/wotlk)

4. ### Gold price Retrieval for Servers
   Stay updated with the current gold prices for each server. This feature tells you when gold prices go up or down,
   which can help you buy low and sell high or decide which server is better to sell gold on. Gold prices are
   fetched from [G2G](https://www.g2g.com)

5. ### Auction House Information Retrieval
   Get detailed auction house information for a specific server. See how much different items are selling for and how
   much supply there is. This can help you spot good deals and stay ahead of the market. Auction House information is
   provided
   by [NexusHub](https://nexushub.co)

6. ### Server Recommendation Retrieval
   Get recommendations on the best servers to farm on based on the items you're planning to farm. The recommendations
   take into account population, item prices, and gold prices.

7. ### Item Deals Retrieval
   This feature provides a list of the best deals for items on a specific server. It helps you identify items that you
   can buy at a low price and sell at a higher price. The discount percentage is calculated based on the difference
   between market value and minimum buyout prices

8. ### Data Filtering
   You can customize and filter the data to get exactly the information you want. Look for specific types of items,
   price ranges, server regions, and more.

9. ### Integration Flexibility
   You can integrate the API into your own projects and applications. This allows you to take full advantage of all the
   features and build custom tools that suit your needs.

Using the EconOMatic API, you can learn a lot about the WoW Classic WOTLK economy and use that knowledge to make smarter
trading decisions and farm gold more effectively.
